# py-marantz-avr-control
Python Code for driving IP Interface for Marantz AVR (MCR510)

The code was derived from a project https://github.com/iamcanadian2222/MarantzIP

but that didn't seem to work for me. 

The Marantz control codes are published here:

http://www.awe-europe.com/documents/Control%20Docs/Marantz/Marantz_AV_SR_NR_PROTOCOL_V02.xls

Simple ones seem to work, though cannot change source at the moment

todo - tidy up and fix - the eventaul goal is to integrate with flask-ask and alexa.
